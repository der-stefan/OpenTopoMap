#  get all saddles, cols and notches with no direction, direction
#  described as text ("north", "nne" ..) or negative directions ("-10" is not
#  an error, but "170" is the same direction). Estimate directions with
#  height data and write this estimation back to datsabase.
#
#  The first run will update nearly all saddles, because most saddles has no
#  mapped direction. The following runs will be faster, because only new
#  saddles will be calculated.
