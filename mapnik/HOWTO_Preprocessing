HOWTO create a generalized database for low zoom levels
=======================================================

A guide by der-stefan (https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap)
http://opentopomap.org

This guide is quite complete, but you should always think before blindly copying the commands.


# Create generalized database

	psql -d lowzoom -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
	psql -d lowzoom -c "CREATE EXTENSION dblink;"
	psql -d gis -c "CREATE EXTENSION dblink;"

	psql -d lowzoom -c "CREATE TABLE water (way geometry(Geometry,3857), name text, \"natural\" text, waterway text, way_area real);"
	psql -d lowzoom -c "INSERT INTO water SELECT * FROM dblink('dbname=gis','SELECT * FROM lowzoom_water') AS t(way geometry(Geometry,3857), name text, \"natural\" text, waterway text, way_area real);"
	
	
	# landuse
	psql -d gis -c "CREATE VIEW lowzoom_landuse AS SELECT ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology(way,150) AS way,landuse,\"natural\" FROM planet_osm_polygon WHERE landuse = 'forest' OR \"natural\" = 'wood' AND way_area > 50000;"

	psql -d lowzoom -c "CREATE TABLE roads (way geometry(LineString,3857), highway text, ref text);"
	psql -d lowzoom -c "INSERT INTO roads SELECT * FROM dblink('dbname=gis','SELECT * FROM lowzoom_roads') AS t(way geometry(LineString,3857), highway text, ref text);"

	psql -d lowzoom -c "INSERT INTO borders SELECT * FROM dblink('dbname=gis','SELECT * FROM lowzoom_borders') AS t(way geometry(LineString,3857), boundary text, admin_level text);"


	# railways
	psql -d gis -c "CREATE VIEW lowzoom_railways AS SELECT ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology(way,50) AS way,railway,\"service\",tunnel FROM planet_osm_line WHERE (\"service\" IS NULL AND railway IN ('rail','light_rail'));"

HOWTO create a function to get saddle directions from contour lines
===================================================================
        
	# allow username to execute dblink_connect_u() to do cross database lookups 
	# replace >username< with the account your renderd is using (maybe "gis" or "tirex" ...)

	psql -d gis -c "GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION dblink_connect_u(text) to username;"
	psql -d gis -c "GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION dblink_connect_u(text,text) to username;"

	# install function getsaddledirection(GEOMETRY,TEXT)
	psql gis <  mapnik/tools/saddledirection.sql

	# Optional: Update all unmapped directions of saddles, cols and notches to improve rendering speed
	UPDATE planet_osm_point SET direction=getsaddledirection(way,direction) WHERE "natural" in ('saddle','col','notch') AND direction IS NULL;
