# This is the default mkgmap style file for applying rules on
# OSM relations.  Usually you will set tags on the
# elements that make up the relation, and the tags will be
# processed by the rules defined in the "points" or "lines" files.
#
# Any line prefaced with # is a comment and will not be applied.
# Each line is a rule, of the generalised format:
#  OSM_tag(s)_to_match  [Garmin_type_code resolution]
# See http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mkgmap/help/style_rules

# Names of administrative boundaries.
# We could want to sort the relations in ascending order of admin_level
# and alphabetically by name first.
# Currently, the matching relations will be processed and the names
# appended to the boundary lines in an arbitrary order.
